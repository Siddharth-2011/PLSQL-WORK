# PLSQL-WORK
**PL/SQL Programs Repository**
This repository contains a collection of PL/SQL programs that I completed as part of my curriculum. The programs cover various fundamental concepts, including cursors, exception handling, functions, the GOTO statement, conditionals, loops, procedures, recursion, triggers, selection operations, and row types.

**Purpose**
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my understanding and proficiency in PL/SQL programming. Each program represents a specific concept or problem that I have successfully implemented in PL/SQL. By examining these programs, readers can gain insights into my knowledge of PL/SQL and how I have applied it to solve real-world scenarios.

Enjoy exploring the PL/SQL programs and delve into the world of database programming with Oracle PL/SQL!
